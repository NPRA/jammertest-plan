Test bands/\"constellation\" refers to potentially afflicted signal types of the 4 GNSS constellations GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou, from the jammer in question. This information must be considered indicative only. The main principle for putting a signal type in the “Test bands/constellation” list for a given jammer or test, is that measurements done by NKOM indicate that the output signal of the jammer covers the center frequency of the given GNSS band(s).",

Unless otherwise stated, jammers will be in \"maximum\" posistion, meaning all relevant antennas are switched on and power is set to as high as possible. Runtime and pauses between tests is set in the transmission plan document.",

For test 13 to 16 the jammers will be turned on sequentially (Example jammer A for 15 minutes, then Jammer A+B for 15 minutes, and then Jammer A+B+C for 15minutes).

Initial time is either False (e.g. a jump in time) or True (less than 100 ns timing error for a receiver at target location). Some test scenarios may be started with jamming (lasting for 5 min, one or several test bands, before the spoofing transmission is activated). Some spoofing scenarios may be accompanied by continuous jamming (one or several test bands).\n\nStatic scenarios are a fixed position, while dynamic scenarios are a drive around the area. For each dynamic test, the motion is first spoofed to a fixed start position for 5 minutes before the dynamic motion starts. \n\nThere will be a break between each test to allow receivers to reacquire fix onto real satellite signals. \n\nWhen max and min powers are indicated, this refers to spoofing power.",

Simulated signals may use one or more constellations and one or more signal bands. \n\nInitial positions are True (target location, normally close to the transmitter antenna location). Initial time is True (less than 100 ns timing error for a receiver at target location). Some test scenarios may be started with jamming (lasting for 5 min, one or several test bands). Some spoofing scenarios may be accompanied by continuous jamming (one or several test bands). The indicated \"Test bands / constellation\" refers to which signals are spoofed. \n\nThere will be a short break between each test and a larger break after the test group is over to allow receivers to reacquire fix onto real satellite signals. \n\nWhen max and min powers are indicated, this refers to spoofing power.",

These are synchronized spoofing scenarios in the sense that the navigation solution (position, velocity and clock bias) should not initially change significantly for a receiver at the target location. The scenarios are coherent in the sense that spoofing signals are similar (aligned with) those received from the actual satellites. Scenarios in these tests are intended to not alter the navigation solution at all for receivers at the target position for position and velocity estimates.

This means that GPS L1 and L2, Galileo E1, and Beidou B1C should be visible in the retransmitted data stream, that the Glonass G1 satellites shouldn't be visible, and that some Beidou B1I satellites might be visible, especially on RX1. However, the filter's frequency cut-offs aren't perfect, so some other satellites might \"leak\" through. \n\nThe tests are performed with a pyramid ramping in tranmsmission power, from 0.01 W to 10 W and back down to 0.01 W, in 5 dB steps. Each step is kept for 2 minutes before the power is increased or decreased. There is planned a 10-minute break between each test.",

The objective is to observe how equipment and systems behave under varying meaconing tranmission powers. Maybe especially interesting is to try to observe when the meaconing signal(s) is(are) strong enough to deceive the DUT receiver, and if the DUT receiver resumes to use the real GNSS signals at the same power levels on the way down of the power pyramid. It could also be of interest to see if the behaviour changes if two meaconing receivers are used instead of only a signle one.",
