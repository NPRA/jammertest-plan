There will be transmitted with a Pseudo Random Noise (PRN) modulation using Right Hand Circular Polarized (RHCP) antennas. PRN signals have the same spectral form as the true signals sent from the GNSS satellites but with different spreading codes. The spreading codes are Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulated onto the centre frequency of the specific GNSS band. The use of a 20 W jammer will result in among the highest J/S ratios during the event. The attendees can change distance to the transmitter and observe the changes and try to identify the protection ratio for your GNSS receiving system.",

The re-transmitted signals needs a lot of amplification, with the added risk of amplifying background noise. Therefore, it is hard to give precise estimates of effective power levels and range. Attendees should try to observe PNT changes and/or loss of PNT, and monitor the changes when their equipment and systems are exposed to two different power levels and varying degrees of time exposure to the meaconed signal. Maybe especially interesting is to see if the effects of movement and speed, coupled with other sensor data, will result on the total output. The tests are performed with constant power outputs (0.1 W or 1 W), and with varying lengths of transmission times [see above for power levels]. There are planned a 15-minute break between each test. Many tests will be performed twice, so that it is possible to try to detect differences between stationary and mobile test objects.\nThe meaconed position is 69.2803484 N, 16.0074695 E.",
