Jammer power levels are based on 2023/2024 measurements. \"Test bands/constellation\" refers to potentially afflicted signal types of the 4 GNSS constellations GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou, from the jammer in question. This information must be considered indicative only. The main principle for putting a signal type in the \"Test bands/constellation\" list for a given jammer or test, is that measurements done by NKOM indicate that the output signal of the jammer covers the center frequency of the given GNSS band(s).",

Jammer power levels are based on 2023/2024 measurements. \"Test bands/constellation\" refers to potentially afflicted signal types of the 4 GNSS constellations GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou, from the jammer in question. This information must be considered indicative only. The main principle for putting a signal type in the \"Test bands/constellation\" list for a given jammer or test, is that measurements done by NKOM indicate that the output signal of the jammer covers the center frequency of the given GNSS band(s).",
          "description": "All tests will be performed with the NEAT military jammers from Novatel placed 1 to 1.5 meters above ground on a pole and be turned on and kept active for a given period (for example for 15 minutes) before being turned off. A break (of for example 6 minutes) is included between tests. The test will then be repeated with different modulation and power levels. For test 1 - 12 the jammers will be turned on simultaneous. For test 13 to 15 the jammers will be turned on sequentially (Example jammer A for 15 minutes, then Jammer A+B for 15 minutes, and then Jammer A+B+C for 15minutes).

Simulated signals may use one or more constellations and one or more signal bands.\n\nInitial positions are either False (e.g. 70 N, 10 E) or True (target location, normally close to the at transmitter antenna location). Initial time is either False (e.g. a jump in time) or True (less than 100 ns timing error for a receiver at target location). Some test scenarios may be started with jamming (lasting for 5 min, one or several test bands, before the spoofing transmission is activated). Some spoofing scenarios may be accompanied by continuous jamming (one or several test bands).\n\nStatic scenarios are a fixed position, while dynamic scenarios are a drive around the area. For each dynamic test, the motion is first spoofed to a fixed start position for 5 minutes before the dynamic motion starts. \n\nThere will be a break between each test to allow receivers to reacquire fix onto real satellite signals. \n\nWhen max and min powers are indicated, this refers to spoofing power.",

Simulated signals may use one or more constellations and one or more signal bands. \n\nInitial positions are True (target location, normally close to the transmitter antenna location). Initial time is True (less than 100 ns timing error for a receiver at target location). Some test scenarios may be started with jamming (lasting for 5 min, one or several test bands). Some spoofing scenarios may be accompanied by continuous jamming (one or several test bands). The indicated \"Test bands / constellation\" refers to which signals are spoofed. \n\nThere will be a short break between each test and a larger break after the test group is over to allow receivers to reacquire fix onto real satellite signals. \n\nWhen max and min powers are indicated, this refers to spoofing power.",

These are synchronized spoofing scenarios in the sense that the navigation solution (position, velocity and clock bias) should not initially change significantly for a receiver at the target location. The scenarios are coherent in the sense that spoofing signals are similar (aligned with) those received from the actual satellites. Scenarios in these tests are intended to not alter the navigation solution at all for receivers at the target position for position and velocity estimates.

The main objective is saturate the CRPA nulling channels with jamming from many directions and then bring in a low powered coherent spoofer between the nulls that will get passed the CRPA electronics to the protected receivers. Three Novatel jammers of the same type are placed in a circle 120 degrees a part. Distance from center is 50 meters (A50, B50 and C50). A coherent spoofer is placed nearby, and will spoof you away from the center position (LOK2_ORIG) onto a given route. \n\nFor the first test the spoofing signal will be shown. For the second test the cirle of jammers will start, and then the same spoofing route will come on air again. The testgroup will further expand with more jammers for each test, repeating the same spoofing route. You might want to set your protected receiver to use L1/E1 only for these tests. ",
