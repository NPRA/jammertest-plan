\section{1.1: Continuous stationary low power jamming with commercially available jammers}

\subsection*{Rationale}

The main objective is to observe how the J/S signal affect the availability of PNT, and/or how it produces inaccurate PNT data, when the jamming signal (J) is generated by low-power jammers commercially available online. Additionally, as these types of jammers are the ones one is most likely to meet in the real world, capturing and storing the signals from these jammers for later use in labs could be useful.

\subsection*{Test description}

All tests will be performed with the jammers place 1 to 1.5 meters above ground (like on top of a vehicle) and be turned on and kept active for two minutes before being turned off. A two minute break is included between tests. Unless otherwise stated, jammers will be in "maximum" posistion, meaning all relevant antennas are switched on and power is set to as high as possible.

\subsection*{Additional information}

Spesification of jammers can be found in appendix A. Jammer power levels are based on 2023 measurements. Test bands/constellations refer to potentially afflicated frequency bands from the jammer in question.

\\\section{1.2: Continuous stationary high-power jamming with CW}

\subsection*{Rationale}

The main objective is to observe how the Jammer signal to GNSS signal (J/S) ratio affect the availability of PNT, and/or how it produces inaccurate PNT data. Phase transitions, going from not being jammed to being jammed and vice versa, are especially interesting, as earlier tests have shown that errors can accumulate to a large extent in these phases (before availability disappears entirely).

\subsection*{Test description}

The use of continuous high-power jamming will block GNSS signals in a large area at the event. The attendees may therefore test their equipment at different ranges to such a high-power jammer. There will be transmitted with a continuous wave (CW) modulation (single frequency component) using Right Hand Circular Polarized (RHCP) antennas. The CW signals will be placed at the centre frequencies of the relevant test bands. The use of a 20 W jammer will result in among the highest J/S ratios during the event. The attendees can change distance to the transmitter and observe the changes and try to identify the protection ratio for their GNSS receiving system.

\subsection*{Additional information}

The jammer employed will be F8.1 "Porcus Major", see appendix A.

Phase transitions, going from not being jammed to being jammed and vice versa, are especially interesting, as earlier tests have shown that errors can accumulate to a large extent in these phases (before availability disappears entirely).

\subsection*{Test description}

The use of continuous high-power jamming will block GNSS signals in a large area at the event. The attendees may therefore test their equipment at different ranges to such a high-power jammer. There will be transmitted with a sweep/chirp modulation using Right Hand Circular Polarized (RHCP) antennas. Sweep/chirp modulation means that the frequency component will sweep back and forth inside the specific frequency band with a given sweep rate. The chirp signal will have a sweet rate of 100 kHz and a bandwidth of 3 MHz, centred at the centre frequency of the relevant test band. The attendees can change distance to the transmitter and observe the changes and try to identify the protection ratio for their GNSS receiving system.

\subsection*{Rationale}

The main objective is to observe how the Jammer signal to GNSS signal (J/S) ratio affect the availability of PNT, and/or how it produces inaccurate PNT data. Phase transitions, going from not being jammed to being jammed and vice versa, are especially interesting, as earlier tests have shown that errors can accumulate to a large extent in these phases (before availability disappears entirely).

\subsection*{Test description}

The use of continuous high-power jamming will block out a large area at the event. The attendees may therefore test the range of such a high-power jammer. There will be transmitted with a Pseudo Random Noise (PRN) modulation using Right Hand Circular Polarized (RHCP) antennas. PRN signals have the same spectral form as the true signals sent from the GNSS satellites but with different spreading codes. The spreading codes are Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulated onto the centre frequency of the relevant test bands. For Mbaud rates, see the annex. The attendees can change distance to the transmitter and observe the changes and try to identify the protection ratio for their GNSS receiving system.

\subsection*{Rationale}

The type of jamming employed in this test is the same as real world signals observed in Europe, where the jammer parameters were found after demodulating a captured baseband stream.

\subsection*{Test description}

The tests will be performed with BPSK modulation with a pseudo random symbol rate of 3 Mbaud at GPS L1 and 10.23 Mbaud at Glonass G1. The test cases refer to which centre frequency of the relevant test bands the signal will be centred at.

\\\section{1.6: Stationary high-power jamming, ramp power with PRN}

\subsection*{Rationale}

The main objective is to observe how the J/S signal affect the loss of PNT, and/or how it produces inaccurate PNT data, and at which power level. This will allow for evaluation of the sensitivity thresholds for various systems and algorithms.

\subsection*{Test description}

The transmitted power will be ramped up and down from a lower to a higher EIRP for each test, with 10 seconds hold time for each power level, with ramping steps of a certain amount of dB. If the last step doesn't add up to a whole dB step (e.g. from [...] 38, 40, 42 dBm to 43.0103 dBm (20 W)), it will be the exact amount of dB to realise the max power (e.g. a 1.0103 dB increment, not a 2 dB increment). The modulation will be PRN. The attendees should be at a stationary location with a known distance to the jammer, so they can observe how different levels will affect the PNT.

\subsection*{Additional information}

The jammer employed will be F8.1 "Porcus Major", see appendix A.

\\\section{1.7: Stationary high-power jamming, ramp power with CW}

\subsection*{Rationale}

The main objective is to observe how the J/S signal affect the loss of PNT, and/or how it produces inaccurate PNT data, and at which power level. This will allow for evaluation of the sensitivity thresholds for various systems and algorithms.

\subsection*{Test description}

The transmitted power will be ramped up and down from a lower to a higher EIRP for each test, with 10 seconds hold time for each power level, with ramping steps of a certain amount of dB. If the last step doesn't add up to a whole dB step (e.g. from [...] 38, 40, 42 dBm to 43.0103 dBm (20 W)), it will be the exact amount of dB to realise the max power (e.g. a 1.0103 dB increment, not a 2 dB increment). The modulation will be CW. The attendees should be at a stationary location with a known distance to the jammer, so they can observe how different levels will affect the PNT.

\subsection*{Additional information}

The jammer employed will be F8.1 "Porcus Major", see appendix A.

\subsection*{Rationale}

The main objective is to simulate meeting several "more dangerous" jammers, multi-band jammers.

\subsection*{Test description}

The test will use three multiband jammers, spaced out in the terrain in different places. Attendees can move around or station themselves so that they can experience the different constellation and observe how their equipment and systems behave in a complicated GNSS RFI environment.

\subsection*{Additional information}

The precise positions for each jammer will have to be decided in field, to best accommodate participants wishes and practical concerns (like terrain). The coordinates for each position, X, Y and Z, will have to be written down in field to help later analysis of the test results.

\\\section{1.14: Stationary very high-power jamming, ramp power with PRN}

\subsection*{Rationale}

The main objective is to observe how the J/S signal affect the loss of PNT, and/or how it produces inaccurate PNT data, and at which power level up to a very high power. This will allow for evaluation of the sensitivity thresholds for various systems and algorithms.

\subsection*{Test description}

The transmitted power will be ramped up and down from a lower to a higher EIRP for each test, where the max power is the highest power that will be experience during the Jammertest event. Each power level holds for 10 seconds, with ramping steps of a certain amount of dB. If the last step doesn't add up to a whole dB step (e.g. from [...] 48, 50, 52 dBm to 53.0103 dBm (200 W)), it will be the exact amount of dB to realise the max power (e.g. a 1.0103 dB increment, not a 2 dB increment). The modulation will be PRN. The attendees should be at a stationary location with a known distance to the jammer, so they can observe how different levels will affect the PNT.

\subsection*{Additional information}

The jammer employed will be "Porcus Major" F8.1, see appendix A.

\\\section{1.15: Stationary low-power jamming of L1 and G1}

\subsection*{Rationale}

The main objective is to test receivers’ ability to change between using GPS and Glonass when one or the other is denied.

\subsection*{Test description}

A 20 MHz wideband (WB) white noise signal will be active on either L1 or G1. Signal power will be ramped up (in 10 dB steps) during the first test, and then kept at the achieved maximum power for the reminder of the tests.

\subsection*{Additional information}

Each test will have a short break after it is completed. When L1-only and G1-only is combined in a test, the transmission will change from the first to the second instantly.

\\\section{1.16: Continuous stationary very high-power jamming with PRN}

\subsection*{Rationale}

The main objective is to observe how the J/S signal affect the loss of PNT, and/or how it produces inaccurate PNT data, at very high power levels or at very long ranges. This will allow for evaluation of both system under extreme duress and allow for the use of a very large testing area, ecspecially suited for ships and airplanes.

\subsection*{Test description}

The use of continuous very high-power jamming will block out a very large area at the event. There will be transmitted with a PseudoRandom Noise (PRN) modulation using Right Hand Circular Polarized (RHCP) antennas. PRN signals have the same spectral form as the true signals sent from the GNSS satellites but with different spreading codes. The spreading codes are Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulated onto the centre frequency of the relevant test bands. For Mbaud rates, see the annex. 

These tests will have the highest transmission power experienced during the Jammertest event.

\subsection*{Additional information}

The jammer employed will be "Porcus Major" F8.1, see appendix A.

\\\section{1.17: Continuous stationary jamming with PRN at airport}

\subsection*{Rationale}

For airplanes, it is often hard to test reactions to GNSS jamming in controlled environment, and especially hard to do so at during approach and departure at an airport. The main objective of these tests is to facilitate just that, so that airplanes can test their systems in full approach and departure modes, at with procedures for a real airport activated.

\subsection*{Test description}

The transmissions will be done at aviation relevant frequencies with varying degrees of transmission power and jamming modulations. The jammer will be placed and directed (with a RHCP directional antenna) along the runway of the airport. There will be transmitted with a Pseudo Random Noise (PRN) modulation using a BPSK spreading codes modulated onto the centre frequency of the relevant test bands. For Mbaud rates, see the annex.

\subsection*{Additional information}

The jammer employed will be APJ, see appendix YY.

\\\section{1.18: Stationary unintentional RFI}

\subsection*{Rationale}

Although intentional GNSS interference (jamming, spoofing and meaconing) is the most known and written about type of GNSS interference, it is not the only one. Actually, it is not even the most common one, that is actually unintentional interference (casued either by equipment error or by frequency use not intended to distrupt GNSS). These tests try to simulate such interference (specifically CWs, self-oscillation events and frequency drifts), to give participants the ability to see how it affects their eqipment and systems, as well as to compare and contrast with different types of intentional interference.

\subsection*{Test description}

The tests will simulate different very common types of unintetional GNSS interference. The transmission power is probably higher than is commonly encountered in the wild, but this can be taken into effect by changing the distances to the interference source. Some of the frequency will be outside of the normal GNSS-bands, this is to create out-of-band interference.

\subsection*{Additional information}

The jammer employed will be "Porcus Major" F8.1, see appendix A.

\\\chapter{2 Spoofing}

\section{2.1: Incoherent position spoofing from stationary spoofer using synthetic ephemerides}

\subsection*{Rationale}

The idea is to test equipment and systems when exposed to false and misleading GNSS-PNT information, with a focus on position. These are very basic attacks that can be performed with easily available software and hardware. These attacks can give an indication to the receivers’ resiliency to spoofing attacks. Most receivers will probably see these attacks as noise initially, effectively working as a jamming signal.

\subsection*{Test description}

Simulated signals will be transmitted from a stationary antenna. Generated spoofing scenarios will use satellite ephemerides different from live sky satellites. Simulated signals may use one or more constellations and one or more signal bands.

Initial positions are either False (e.g. 70 N, 10 E) or True (target location, normally close to the at transmitter antenna location). Initial time is either False (e.g. a jump in time) or True (less than 100 ns timing error for a receiver at target location). Some test scenarios may be started with jamming (lasting for 5 min, one or several test bands, before the spoofing transmission is activated). Some spoofing scenarios may be accompanied by continuous jamming (one or several test bands).

Static scenarios are a fixed position, while dynamic scenarios are a drive around the area. For each dynamic test, the motion is first spoofed to a fixed start position for 5 minutes before the dynamic motion starts. 

There will be a break between each test to allow receivers to reacquire fix onto real satellite signals. 

When max and min powers are indicated, this refers to spoofing power.

\subsection*{Additional information}

Expected (least) range/power of spoofing signals: A radius of approximately 1.5 kilometre from the transmitter, depending on terrain and building signal shielding.

\subsection*{Rationale}

The idea is to test equipment and systems when exposed to false and misleading GNSS-PNT information, with a focus on position. These spoofing tests use ephemerides (navigation data) identical to those broadcasted by the actual satellites, but the transmitted spoofing signals do not align with those received from actual satellites (incoherent). Receivers using the spoofed signals will (most likely) generate jumps in the navigation solution, either in position, time and/or velocity.

\subsection*{Test description}

Simulated signals will be transmitted from a stationary antenna. Generated spoofing scenarios will use broadcast satellite ephemeris data. Simulated signals may use one or more constellations and one or more test bands.

Initial positions are either False (e.g. 70 N, 10 E) or True (target location, normally close to the transmitter antenna location). Initial time is either False (e.g. a jump in time/date) or True (less than 100 ns timing error for a receiver at target location). Some test scenarios may be started with jamming (lasting for 5 min, one or several test bands, before the spoofing transmission is activated). Some spoofing scenarios may be accompanied by continuous jamming (one or several test bands). The indicated "Test bands / constellation" refers to which signals are spoofed. 

Static scenarios are a fixed position, while dynamic scenarios are a simulated drive around the area. For each dynamic test, the motion is first spoofed to a fixed start position for 5 minutes before the dynamic motion starts. 

There will be a break between each test to allow receivers to reacquire fix onto real satellite signals. 

When max and min powers are indicated, this refers to spoofing power.

\subsection*{Additional information}

Expected (least) range/power of spoofing signals: A radius of approximately 1.5 kilometre from the transmitter, depending on terrain and building signal shielding.

\subsection*{Rationale}

The idea is to test equipment and systems when exposed to false and misleading GNSS-PNT information, with a focus on position. These spoofing tests use ephemerides (navigation data) identical to those broadcasted by the actual satellites. The transmitted spoofing signals are intended to align (to within a few 100 ns) with those received from actual satellites at the target location (coherent). Receivers using the spoofed signals at rest at the target location will initially generate no major changes in the navigation solution, either in position, time and/or velocity, compared to the solution estimated from actual satellite signals.

\subsection*{Test description}

Simulated signals will be transmitted from a stationary antenna. Generated spoofing scenarios will use broadcast satellite ephemeris data. Simulated signals may use one or more constellations and one or more signal bands.

Initial positions are True (target location, normally close to the transmitter antenna location). Initial time is True (less than 100 ns timing error for a receiver at target location). Some test scenarios may be started with jamming (lasting for 5 min, one or several test bands, before the spoofing transmission is activated). Some spoofing scenarios may be 
accompanied by continuous jamming (one or several test bands). The indicated "Test bands / constellation" refers to which signals are spoofed. 

Static scenarios are a fixed position, while dynamic scenarios are a simulated drive around the area. For each dynamic test, the motion is first spoofed to a fixed start position for 5 minutes before the dynamic motion starts. 

There will be a break between each test to allow receivers to reacquire fix onto real satellite signals. 

For all tests in this group, spoofing transmission will be corrected for signal delay to simulated start position. 

When max and min powers are indicated, this refers to spoofing power.

\subsection*{Additional information}

Expected (least) range/power of spoofing signals: A radius of approximately 1.5 kilometre from the transmitter, depending on terrain and building signal shielding.

\\\section{2.4: Incoherent time spoofing from stationary spoofer using synthetic ephemerides}

\subsection*{Rationale}

The idea is to test equipment and systems when exposed to false and misleading GNSS-PNT information, with a focus on timing. These are synchronized spoofing scenarios in the sense that the navigation solution (position, velocity and clock bias) should not initially change significantly for a receiver at the target location. The scenarios are incoherent in the sense that spoofing signals are different from (not aligned with) those received from the actual satellites.

\subsection*{Test description}

Simulated signals will be transmitted from a stationary antenna. Generated spoofing scenarios will use satellite ephemerides different from live sky satellites. Simulated signals may use one or more constellations and one or more signal bands. 

Initial positions are True (target location, normally close to the transmitter antenna location). Some test scenarios may be started with jamming (lasting for 5 min, one or several test bands). Some spoofing scenarios may be accompanied by continuous jamming (one or several test bands). The indicated "Test bands / constellation" refers to which signals are spoofed. 

There will be a small break between each test and a larger break after the test group is over to allow receivers to reacquire fix onto real satellite signals. 

When max and min powers are indicated, this refers to spoofing power.

\subsection*{Additional information}

\subsection*{Rationale}

The objective is to simulate a vehicle-borne spoofing device "out in the wild", so that attendees can experience how a mobile spoofing source affects their (stationary or mobile) equipment and systems.

\subsection*{Test description}

A SDR spoofer will be employed in different ways in and around vehicles. The spoofed signals will be on GPS L1 only. All spoofing tests will be combined with jamming on Glonass G1. Both jamming and sppfing will be done with 10 dBm. The indicated "Test bands / constellation" refers to which signals are spoofed. 

There will be a break between each test to allow receivers to reacquire fix onto real satellite signals.

\subsection*{Additional information}

Starting position will be approximately 69.194875 N, 15.837719 E in all scenarios (might change due to operational requests).

Some equipment will use GNSS to provide time or to synchronize time dependent systems. The equipment and subsystems being fed this timing information can use this time for for example checking validity of licences, certificates, etc. This test can be used to check for unintended effects of large time shifts on equipment and subsystems.

\subsection*{Test description}

Providing a date 2 years back in time or 2 years ahead can cause denial of service for some down-stream services. The test will move the date 2 years back or forth from the day that the test is being executed at.

\subsection*{Additional information}

The effect on subsystems is not known and hence care should be taken to limit the range of the transmission to include (as best as possible) only DUT eqipment and systems.

\\\section{2.8: Stationary SBAS spoofing with "Do Not Use GPS" commands}

\subsection*{Rationale}

On the 9th of October 2023, the European SBAS system EGNOS erroneously made the satellites broadcast a GIC-information that declared all GPS satellites as unusable, which caused a lot of problems for EGNOS users, ranging from no effect at all to rapid fluctuations in GPS availability to no GPS service at all (variations probably caused by different impelemtations in user equipment). This test is to replicate that EGNOS phenomenon. For more information on this event, see EGNOS Service Notice Number: 028 (10/10/2023).

\subsection*{Test description}

The test will only transmit EGNOS signals, that should be as close to real signals as possible, only with a different GIC information, that now tells the EGNOS boradcasted signal recipient to not use GPS.

\section{3.1: Stationary meaconing from single receiver}

\subsection*{Rationale}

The objective is to observe how equipment and systems behave under meaconing from a single receiver, with and without initital jammming. Attendees should try to observe PNT changes and/or loss of PNT, and monitor the changes when their equipment and systems are exposed to two different power levels. Maybe especially interesting is to see how the effects of movement and speed, coupled with other sensor data, will result the total output. Some tests might be repeated, so that it is possible to try to detect differences between for example stationary and mobile test objects, or to allow for configuration of other participants setups to test different variables in the same RFI environment.

\subsection*{Test description}

GNSS re-transmission of real live sky signals from one receiver, where the GNSS environment will have wrong position with real satellite data, only slightly time delayed.
The test will re-transmitt on the L1 and L2 bands, where the employed antennas for receivers RX1 and RX2 have cut-off frequencies at 1562 – 1588 MHz (L1) \& 1216 – 1240 MHz (L2) and 1564 – 1586 MHz (L1) \& 1218 – 1238 MHz (L2), respectivly. This means that GPS L1 and L2, Galileo E1, and Beidou B1 should be visible, that the Glonass G1 satellites shouldn't be visiable, and that some Beidou B1I satellites might be, especially on RX1. The tests are performed with constant transmission power, some with initial jamming and some without. There is planned a 10-minute break between each test. 
The meaconed position is for RX1: (TBD1) and for RX2: (TBD2).

\subsection*{Additional information}

The jammer employed will be F8.1 "Porcus Major", see appendix A. The meaconing setup employed, "M", is explained in Appendix XX.

\subsection*{Rationale}

The objective is to observe how equipment and systems behave under meaconing from two receivers, with and without initital jammming. Attendees should try to observe PNT changes and/or loss of PNT, and monitor the changes when their equipment and systems are exposed to two different meaconed signals. Maybe especially interesting is to see if positions jump between the two meaconed posistions, stay stable or if two meaconed signals aid in GNSS RFI detection somewhat.

\subsection*{Test description}

GNSS re-transmission of real live sky signals from two receivers (RX1 and RX2), with the same receivers specifications as listed in "Meaconing testgroup 1". 
The tests are performed with constant power outputs, some with initial jamming and some without. There is planned a 10-minute break between each test.

\subsection*{Additional information}

\\\section{3.3: Stationary meaconing from a single or two receivers with pyramid ramping power}

\subsection*{Rationale}

The objective is to observe how equipment and systems behave under varying meaconing tranmission powers. Maybe especially interesting is to try to observe when the meaconing signal(s) is(are) strong enough to deceive the DUT receiver, and if the DUT receiver resumes to use the real GNSS signals at the same power levels on the way down of the power pyramid. It could also be of interest to see if the behaviour changes if two meaconing receivers are used instead of only a signle one.

\subsection*{Test description}

GNSS re-transmission of real live sky signals from two receiver (RX1 and RX2), with the same receivers specifications as listed in "Meaconing testgroup 1". The tests are performed with a pyramid ramping in tranmsmission power, from 0.01 W to 10 W and back down to 0.01 W, in 5 dB steps. Each step is kept for 2 minutes before the power is increased or decreased. There is planned a 10-minute break between each test.

\subsection*{Additional information}

The jammer employed will be F8.1 "Porcus Major", see appendix A. The meaconing setup employed, "M", is explained in Appendix XX.
